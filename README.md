# Welcome To Magical Study 

# Introduction
Nowadays due to the current pandemic issue of covid19, all schools are closed because of safety requirements. This affects the studies of children. As a solution to this problem, we will develop a mobile application which is compatible with both Android and IOS platform. There are so many websites that are available for this purpose but they are not user friendly for kids. Our application will be easy to use even for kids. Children of preschool can learn Mathematics, English, General knowledge etc. using this app. And there are Rhymes and stories too for learning with fun.
